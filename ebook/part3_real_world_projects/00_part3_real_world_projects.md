# Part III – Real-World Projects and Automation

In this final section, you’ll put your Bash skills into practice with hands-on projects designed for enterprise-grade macOS management and security.

**What you’ll build:**

- Scripts for automating security baselines and system hardening
- Hardware and software inventory collection with export to CSV/JSON
- Custom installer wrappers with preconditions, user prompts, and post-install checks
- Secure backup and restore solutions using Time Machine, `rsync`, and encryption
- Osquery deployment scripts for endpoint logging and monitoring
- Patch management workflows with auto-updates, logging, and user notifications
- Automated compliance checks and alerting mechanisms for deviations

These projects reflect real-world needs of macOS administrators and security engineers, giving you reusable templates to streamline your work while maintaining security best practices.
