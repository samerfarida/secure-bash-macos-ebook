## D.5 Author's Favorites

I recommend subscribing to security mailing lists, following macOS security and scripting blogs, and joining relevant GitHub repositories to stay current. The macOS ecosystem evolves fast — staying connected helps you keep your Bash scripts secure, compatible, and powerful. Participate in open-source projects, contribute back improvements, and share knowledge with the MacAdmin community.
