# Part II – Advanced Bash and macOS Security Scripting

This section takes your Bash skills further, focusing on advanced scripting techniques, macOS internals, and secure automation practices.

**What you'll learn:**

- Chapter 6: Writing robust scripts with conditionals, loops, and functions
- Chapter 7: Understanding Unix file permissions and using `chmod`, `chown`, and `find` to audit file access
- Chapter 8: Techniques for error handling, debugging with `set -x`, and logging with `trap`
- Chapter 9: Managing environment variables, configuration files (.bash_profile, .bashrc), and user sessions on macOS
- Chapter 10: Working with `launchd`, `launchctl`, and understanding System Integrity Protection (SIP)
- Chapter 11: Practical security hardening: safe input handling, avoiding code injection, and least privilege principles
- Chapter 12: Integrating Bash with macOS tools like AppleScript (osascript), Keychain access, and MDM verification
- Chapter 13: Building interactive GUI-driven scripts with osascript, swiftDialog, and Platypus for user-friendly automation

By the end of this part, you'll be able to write resilient, security-focused Bash scripts ready for enterprise deployment on macOS fleets.
