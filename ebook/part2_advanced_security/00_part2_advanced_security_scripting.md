This section takes your Bash skills further, focusing on advanced scripting techniques, macOS internals, and secure automation practices.

**What you’ll learn:**

- Writing robust scripts with conditionals, loops, and functions
- Techniques for error handling, logging, and debugging
- Managing environment variables, configuration files, and user sessions on macOS
- Working with `launchd`, `launchctl`, and understanding System Integrity Protection (SIP)
- Practical security hardening: safe input handling, sandboxing, and least privilege principles
- Integrating Bash with macOS tools like AppleScript, Automator, and the Keychain

By the end of this part, you’ll be able to write resilient, security-focused Bash scripts ready for enterprise deployment on macOS fleets.
