# About the Author

Sammy Farida is a U.S. Army veteran, security architect, and lifelong technologist. Born and raised in Iraq, Sammy worked as a translator for the U.S. military during the Iraq War before immigrating to the United States in 2007. He later enlisted in the U.S. Army and deployed back to Iraq—this time as an American soldier.

After his military service, Sammy transitioned into the field of cybersecurity and currently works as a Global Solution Security Architect at PwC, where he focuses on endpoint security, automation, and secure architecture at scale.

Sammy is passionate about scripting, open-source tools, and making complex technical topics accessible. This ebook was born out of countless hours writing, reviewing, and deploying secure Bash scripts in macOS environments—from personal automation to enterprise-scale fleet management.
